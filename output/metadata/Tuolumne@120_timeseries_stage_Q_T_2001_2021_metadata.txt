** Title: Tuolumne River where it passes under Highway 120 stage, temperature, and discharge
** PI:  Jessica D. Lundquist (jdlund@uw.edu), University of Washington
** Funding:  National Science Foundation, CBET-0729830, and NASA Grant-NNX15AB29G


** Summary:
Half-hourly recordings of raw pressure (in cm of water), water pressure (in cm of water, with 
atmospheric pressure removed), estimated discharge (in cubic-feet-per-second), and water
temperature (in degrees Celcius), from instruments located on Tuolumne River where it passes under
Highway 120 in Tuolumne Meadows,
Yosemite National Park, for water years
2001 to 2021. These measurements were taken by Solinst Leveloggers of various models.

Tuolumne River Watershed, Yosemite National Park
Approximate Coordinates: 37.87629 N, 119.35475 W (datum: NAD 83)

** Site History: Important Changes in Site Setup and Missing Data 
- Staff plate installed in 2006
- CR1000 & CS450 P.T installed 10/10/2012
- 6/25/19 it was observed the bottom portion of staff plate ripped off; the staff plate was replaced and resurveyed
- The record is believed to be stable through the present. It is expected the site will be temporarily uninstalled (and reinstalled) during late summer 2022 for construction on the Tioga Bridge



** Variables and Units:
Note: the raw_pressure can either reflect vented or unvented levelogger data (depending on data 
availability and quality). When available, vented data is preferred to unvented data. To determine
which sensor was used at a particular time step, compare the 'raw_pressure(cm)' column to the
'barocorrected_pressure(cm)' column. If the two values are the same, the data is from a vented Levelogger.
If they differ, the data is from an unvented Levelogger.

date_time(UTC:PDT+7)       - time stamp in UTC, in format "yyyy/mm/dd HH:MM:SS", midnight = 00:00:00
raw_pressure(cm)           - raw data from the logger (either vented or unvented) (cm of water)
barocorrected_pressure(cm) - raw Levelogger data minus atmospheric pressure, same as raw when vented
                             logger is selected for period (cm of water)
adjusted_stage(cm)         - vented or baroccorrected pressure plus offset used to align with manual 
                             measurements/previous record (cm of water)
estimated_discharge(cms)   - calculated using rating curve defined below (cubic-meters-per-second, cms)
water_temperature(deg_C)   - raw stream temperature recorded by the Levelogger (degrees Celsius)
discharge_flag             - QC flag defined below
NaN = no data


** Discharge Flags:
0 = No detected anomoly, ice jam, or malfunction
1 = Anomalous single timestep readings ("blips"). Corrected to average of previous and subsequent recording
2 = High stage recordings created by ice blocking river flow.
3 = Sensor malfunction


** Instrument Models:
The following instruments are used for vented pressure collection:
(starting in 2012)
Campbell Scientific CR1000 Datalogger
Campbell Scientific CS450-L P.T.

Unvented pressure data is collected using Solinst Leveloggers of several models: Levelogger Edge, Levelogger Gold
and Levelogger Junior. See the official documentation for more details:
https://www.solinst.com/products/dataloggers-and-telemetry/3001-levelogger-series/operating-instructions/previous-instruction-versions/3001-user-guide-v4-4-0.pdf


** Rating Curves:
The rating curve equation used to estimate discharge is
for H < 0.8011m, Q = 34.3522*(H-0.7639)^1.465
for H > 0.8011m, Q = 17.0873(H-0.7076)^1.7401

Note: The greatest uncertainties occur at very high flows (due to the small number of manual measurements in that
range) and at very low flows (due to uncertainty in the gauge datum and the exact water depth above the sensor
when discharge stops).


** Data Postprocessing and Quality Control Summary:
This file includes raw, corrected, and estimated data. The 'raw_pressure(cm)' data is a temporally-continuous 
record made up of a number of different loggers deployed through time (generally changed once per summer). 
The corrected data includes both the 'barocorrected_pressure(cm)' and 'adjusted_stage(cm)' time series, 
which apply an atmospheric pressure correction and datum correction, respectively. The 
'estimated_discharge(cms)' time series is an estimate of discharge computed using the 'adjusted_stage(cm)' time series
and site rating curve (which is built using manual measurements collected over several summers). 
The postprocessing includes all the of steps needed to translate the 'raw_pressure(cm)' time series into 
the 'estimated_discharge(cms)' time series. There is a summary of the steps below. For a comprehensive, 
thorough view of the post processing, visit the following url, where all steps are documented in Jupyter notebooks:
https://github.com/Mountain-Hydrology-Research-Group/tum_hydro_postprocessing_2022

For each site, the following operations were completed:
1. Both vented and unvented Levelogger time series were inspected, trimmed (to the segment when the sensor
   was actively deployed), converted to appropriate units, and examined for sensor malfunctions, ice jams, 
   and sensor shifts.
2. A barometric pressure correction was applied to the unvented Levelogger time series using colocated Barologger 
   time series when available and NCAR Reanalysis surface pressure data otherwise. When NCAR Reanalysis data was 
   used, a hypsometric elevation correction was applied before performing the barometric correction. 
3. An offset was applied to both vented and barometrically corrected unvented Levelogger time series to convert 
   to the stage reference datum. Offsets are typically estimated by comparing the 'barocorrected_pressure(cm)' to 
   previous corrected time series and/or available manual stage measurements. 
4. For each water year, either the vented or corrected unvented Levelogger time series was selected 
   (based on data availability and quality) as the stage measurement ('adjusted_stage(cm)')
5. Stage time series from consecutive years were concatenated
6. Discharge was estimated using the stage time series and documented rating curve.
